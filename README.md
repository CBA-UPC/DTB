# Deep Tracking Blocker (DTB+)
A Firefox extension to avoid being tracked online and protect your personal information while browsing the website. The web tracking detection is permormed by two ways: the first uses a Deep Neural Network trained with millions of URLs to distinguish between tracking and safe URL calls. It is the result of a research publication made by the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya publicly available at ["URL-based Web Tracking Detection Using Deep Learning"](http://dl.ifip.org/db/conf/cnsm/cnsm2020/1570659553.pdf). The second method checks the resource hash with a list of hashes generated by TrackSign, a tool which identifies trackers by comparing the fingerprints of resources shared by the top-100K websites. TrackSign is the result of a pubilcation also made by Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) available at ["TrackSign: Guided Web Tracking Discovery"](http://pbarlet.site.ac.upc.edu/papers/TrackSign.Infocom2021.pdf)
